## Project Overview

The objective is to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration).

### How to play

* The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match.

At each turn:
-   The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
-   The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
-   If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
-   If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

### Game Functionality

In the real-life game, players flip over cards to locate the pairs that match. The goal is to recreate this. These are the events that need to be handled:
-   Flipping cards
-   What happens when cards match
-   What happens when cards do not match
-   When the game finishes
